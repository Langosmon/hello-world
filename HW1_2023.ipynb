For the last problem, you will be making use of a numerical model, originally written in Python by OU Prof. Brian Fiedler and modified by yours truly. This model solves the nondimensional, inviscid, Boussinesq equations of motion and can be used to demonstrate many physical principles of atmospheric flow: in this case, the physics of rising buoyant thermal bubbles.\n",

    "You have a beach ball with an uninflated mass of 1.0 kg (the mass of the plastic skin). You inflate the beach ball to a diameter of 1 m using ambient air such that the pressure, temperature, and water vapor specific humidity of the air inside the beach ball are all the same as the ambient air outside of it. Specifically, the temperature is $T=305$ K, the water vapor specific humidity is $q_v=15$ g kg$^{-1}$, and the pressure is $p=$1015 hPa. Nearby is a swimming pool with water at the same temperature as the air and a density $\\rho_l$=1000 kg m$^{-3}$. You then take the beach ball and immerse it completely under the water (which is no small feat given its immense size; I'll leave it to your imagination how you would accomplish it). For the following problems, assume that the beach ball is perfectly rigid and doesn't change volume when you put it under the water. You can also neglect the very small thickness of the plastic relative to that of the inflated diameter (but *not* its mass).\n",
    "\n",
    "> a) (10 pts) Archimedes principle states that an upward force exists on an object immersed in a fluid, and that this force is equal to the weight of the fluid that is displaced. From this principle and the other information given above, calculate the *net* force on the beach ball: $F_{net} = F_{A} - F_{g}$, where $F_A$ is the Archimedean force, and $F_g$ is the weight of the beach ball (including both that of the air inside of it and the plastic material). NOTE: a minor point of confusion can occur here: in many contexts, it is only this *upward* force resulting from the displacement of the water by the object that is called the \"buoyancy\" ($F_A$ above), while in other contexts, such as in most meteorological applications, the \"buoyancy\" instead refers to the *net* force after the weight of the object itself is subtracted off ($F_{net}$). To avoid confusion here I am simply calling the former version the *Archimedean* force, but you should be able to tell from the context what specifically is meant by \"buoyancy\". \n",

    "> b) (10 pts) Show that the $\\textit{net buoyant acceleration}$ on the beach ball can be written as:\n",
    "$$B=g\\frac{\\rho'}{\\rho_b}$$ where $\\rho' \\equiv \\rho_l-\\rho_b$ and $\\rho_b$ is the *bulk* density of the beach ball (taking into account both the mass of the air inside and the plastic material). NOTE: by \"show\", I mean *derive* this equation from the Archimedean principle and informed by the previous discussion. Be sure to show all your steps! Compare this expression for buoyancy acceleration with the version we found in class during our derivation of the perturbation form of the vertical momentum equation. Then, calculate the magnitude of $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "> c) (20 pts) CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) in the atmosphere is defined as $\\text{CAPE}=\\int_{z_{LFC}}^{z_{EL}} B dz$, where $z_{LFC}$ and $z_{EL}$ are the heights of the LFC and EL, respectively, and $B$ is the buoyancy of a hypothetical lifted air parcel that, in general, varies as a function of height. For a *constant* $B$ with height, this simplifies to $\\text{CAPE}=B\\Delta z$ where $\\Delta z=z_{EL} - z_{LFC}$. A CAPE of 5000 J/kg is considered on the high end and is supportive of intense convective updrafts and an enhanced threat of severe hazards, and the distance $\\Delta z$ from the LFC to EL can be several km. If we treat our beach ball to be the \"parcel\" and the swimming pool to be the \"atmosphere\" the parcel is being lifted through we can calculate an analogous \"CAPE\" that tells us the potential energy that may be available to accelerate our beach ball upward over a certain distance $\\Delta z$. \n",
    "\n",

    ">> ii. (10 pts) Assuming that all of this potential energy is converted to the kinetic energy of the rising beach ball, how fast would the beach ball be going after rising this distance? Does this seem realistic to you? Discuss."

In such a case we would have an additional term in the conservation equation for $b$ that represents this stratification, and the perturbation density would be interpreted as a deviation from $\\overline{\\rho}$ instead of $\\rho_0$, while the buoyancy term would still have $\\rho_0$ in its denominator. We will examine this case in future lectures/assignments when we deal with static instability, but don't worry about it for now. "

    "Your task here is to test the impact of changing the width of the initial bubble, while keeping the depth the same. So, go back up to the cell where you initialize the thermal bubble and change the value of xrad to the following values (*one at a time*): [200, 400, 600, 800] VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure you also change the experiment name for each (i.e. you can just use [xrad2, xrad4, xrad6, xrad8]), otherwise you will end up just overwriting the values from the original experiment each time. Then go through and run each cell up to and including the animation loop to run the simulation for the given value of xrad. So, in the end you will have 5 experiments, including the original one. Then, to make sure you have done everything correctly, execute the following cell and note the output. If you did it right, you should see the printout of the dictionary having a separate entry for each experiment you ran. It will look something like this:\n",

    "> a) (25 pts) Make a plot similar to above for the height of the maximum buoyancy vs. time for each experiment, all overlaid on the same plot. The above plot is quick-and-dirty; you should make this new plot cleaner and include the axis labels along with units. Make each experiment's curve a different color and/or line style and include a legend that clearly labels each.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> b) (15 points) Explain the physical reason for the trend you are seeing. Note that the buoyancy force at the location of maximum buoyancy is roughly the same for each experiment, since you aren't changing the magnitude of the buoyancy in the initial bubble, but only the width of the bubble. So in other words, why does changing the width, but not the magnitude, lead to the trend you are seeing?"
